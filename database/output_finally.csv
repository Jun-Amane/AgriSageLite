Laysan_Albatross,莱萨信天翁,"A large seabird with very long, narrow wings; much larger than shearwaters and petrels. Unmistakable with white body, dingy pinkish bill, and dark markings on underwing. Fairly common offshore throughout North Pacific, as far north as the Bering Sea. Occasionally seen from shore. Breeds mainly in Hawaii, where it is often confiding and unafraid of humans. Nests on the ground in coastal areas of Kauai and northern Oahu; abundant in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Smaller colonies also exist off Japan and Mexico. Calls include whinnying, low cow-like “moo,” soft grunts, and squeals. Also claps bill.",一种翅膀很长很窄的大型海鸟;比海鸥和海燕大得多。白色的身体，暗淡的粉红色的喙，翅膀下有深色的斑纹。在北太平洋沿岸相当常见，北至白令海。偶尔从岸上看到。主要在夏威夷繁殖，在那里它通常是信任和不怕人类。在考艾岛和瓦胡岛北部沿海地区的地面筑巢;在夏威夷群岛西北部丰富。日本和墨西哥附近也有较小的殖民地。叫声包括呜咽，像牛一样低的“哞”，柔和的咕噜声和尖叫声。也为比尔鼓掌。,https://ebird.org/species/layalb
Sooty_Albatross,烟信天翁,"A beautiful smoky-brown albatross with bright white eye crescents and an orange line running down the bill that gives this otherwise regal bird a goofy appearance. Unlike the otherwise similar Light-mantled Albatross, the present species’ dark head does not contrast with the rest of the body. Also note Light-mantled’s less obvious blue-gray bill line. Dark morph giant-petrels can be similar at a glance, but have larger, bulbous pink bills, and average more long-necked and hunch-backed in appearance. A pelagic species, ranging throughout much of the southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Nests on a handful of islands in that region, favoring areas with steep rocky slopes and tussock grass.",一只美丽的烟棕色信天翁，明亮的白色月牙眼，喙上有一条橙色的线条，这使这种原本威严的鸟看起来很傻。与其他类似的轻羽信天翁不同，现在的信天翁深色的头部与身体的其他部分没有对比。也要注意光罩的不太明显的蓝灰色喙线。乍一看，深色巨海燕很相似，但它们有更大的球状粉红色喙，平均脖子更长，背部驼背。一种远洋物种，分布在南大西洋和印度洋的大部分地区。在该地区的少数岛屿上筑巢，喜欢陡峭的岩石斜坡和草丛。,https://ebird.org/species/sooalb1
Groove_billed_Ani,沟嘴鸟,"Anis are bizarre, coal-black cuckoos with long floppy tails and unique, curiously tall, flattened bills. Groove-billed occurs in a variety of open and semi-open habitats in tropical lowlands and foothills, typically staying low in shrubs and grasses. Gregarious and not particularly graceful; usually seen crashing around awkwardly in small groups. Flies with choppy wingbeats and long glides. Widespread and common throughout Middle America, as far north as Texas. In South America, primarily occurs west of the Andes; also in inter-Andean valleys and lowlands of northern Colombia and Venezuela. Compare with the very similar Smooth-billed Ani, which overlaps locally. Note especially the bill shape: Groove-billed typically has a lower, more evenly rounded top edge to the bill without an obvious keel, and the lower edge of the bill is straighter. Grooves are distinctive but can be difficult to see. Voice is also important: listen for a sharp “PIT!-tooee” and other sharp clicks and whistles.",沟嘴鸟是一种奇怪的煤黑色杜鹃，长着柔软的长尾和独特的、高而扁平的喙。沟嘴鸟出现在热带低地和山麓的各种开放和半开放的栖息地，通常停留在低矮的灌木和草丛中。群居的，不特别优雅的;通常在小群中笨拙地乱撞。翅膀拍动起伏，滑翔时间长。广泛分布于美国中部，北至德克萨斯州。在南美洲，主要发生在安第斯山脉以西;也生长在安第斯山脉间的山谷和哥伦比亚北部和委内瑞拉的低地。与非常相似的光滑嘴阿尼相比，它们在局部重叠。特别注意嘴的形状:凹槽嘴通常有一个较低的，更均匀的圆形上边缘到嘴没有明显的龙骨，和嘴的下边缘更直。凹槽是独特的，但很难看到。声音也很重要:听一个尖锐的“PIT!”还有其他尖锐的咔哒声和哨声。,https://ebird.org/species/grbani
Crested_Auklet,冠海雀,"Dumpy, dark alcid with pale eyes; very small, only slightly larger than a sparrow. Note the thin white “whiskers” trailing backwards from behind each eye. Breeding birds are dark gray-black overall, with a droopy forward-arching crest and a bright orange bill with an uptilted gape which gives them a maniacally grinning appearance.

Gives frequent, consistent squawks and squeaks at colonies. Readily separable from other auklets due to its whiter plumage and smaller size.",数量众多的小海雀，只比麻雀稍大。夏季在岩石海岸附近的大群中出现，冬季在远离海岸的小群中出现。夏季的羽毛看起来凌乱，腹部周围有许多灰色斑点。冬季的羽毛则有鲜明的白色腹部和肩部。在蜂群里发出频繁的、持续的吱吱声。很容易从其他小海雀中分离出来，因为它的羽毛更白，体型更小。,https://ebird.org/species/leaauk
Parakeet_Auklet,鹦鹉海雀,"Dumpy, medium-sized alcid with a bright orange bill. Pale button eye and upturned gape give it a distinctly maniacal, smiling appearance. Blackish above and white below, with a long white “whisker” extending down from behind the eye in breeding season; in wintering birds, white extends up onto the throat. Clean white belly distinguishes this species from other similar auklets.

House_Wren,家鹪鹩,"Small brownish wren with extensive variation across range. Usually rather plain overall, with dark barring on the wings and tail. Lacks white eyebrow. Especially variable in the Caribbean; some populations are rich rusty-brown overall, others are almost white below. Occurs in a variety of open or semiopen habitats, including suburbs, parks, rural farmland, and woodland edge with thick tangles. Often perches conspicuously when singing, but otherwise fairly secretive. Listen for bubbly song of chatters and trills, and harsh scolding calls.",褐色的小鹪鹩，分布范围很广。通常总体上很普通，翅膀和尾巴上有深色的横纹。没有白色的眉毛。在加勒比地区尤其多变;一些种群整体呈丰富的锈褐色，其他种群的下面几乎是白色。发生在各种开放或半开放的栖息地，包括郊区，公园，农村农田，林地边缘与厚缠结。通常在唱歌时栖息在显眼的地方，但其他时候相当隐蔽。听着欢快的啁啾声和颤音，还有刺耳的责骂声。,https://ebird.org/species/houwre
Marsh_Wren,沼泽鹪鹩,"Habitat is the best clue for identifying this wren; rarely strays from cattail marshes and rushes for breeding. Migrants occasionally move into wet fields. Often difficult to see well as it skulks through grasses. Its plumage is rather bright rufous with darker brown cap, contrasting whitish eyebrow and throat, and black-and-white stripes on back. Overall darker and more contrasting than similar Sedge Wren.",栖息地是识别鹪鹩的最佳线索;很少离开香蒲沼泽和冲去繁殖。迁徙者偶尔会进入潮湿的田地。通常很难看清，因为它躲在草丛中。它的羽毛是相当明亮的红褐色与深褐色的帽，对比白色的眉毛和喉咙，和黑白条纹的背部。整体颜色较深，比类似的莎草鹪鹩更具对比性。,https://ebird.org/species/marwre
Rock_Wren,岩鹪鹩,"True to its name, prefers rocky areas, especially rocky slopes. Often perches conspicuously and bobs up and down. Pale grayish wren with whitish throat, buffy sides, and long, slightly decurved bill. Tiny speckles on back and wings like grains of sand. Undertail coverts barred black and white. Paler overall than Canyon Wren with a pale, buffy belly. Listen for its ringing vocalization. Sexes alike.",顾名思义，它喜欢多岩石的地区，尤其是多岩石的斜坡。经常栖息在显眼的地方，上下摆动。浅灰色的鹪鹩，喉咙发白，两侧肉色，喙长而略弯曲。背上和翅膀上的小斑点就像沙粒一样。尾底羽绒有黑色和白色条纹。整体比峡谷鹪鹩苍白，腹部呈灰白色。听它响亮的叫声。两性相似。,https://ebird.org/species/rocwre
Winter_Wren,冬鹪鹩,"Tiny, short-tailed, plain-brown wren with a huge voice. Subtly patterned, with indistinct pale eyebrow and diffuse dark barring on flanks and wings. Constantly keeps tail cocked at an angle. Found in a variety of forested habitats, but always prefers wetter areas with thick tangles, often around treefalls and moss. Darker, smaller, and shorter-tailed than House Wren. Incredibly beautiful song is a long series of musical whistles and trills; an unmistakable and common sound in northern forests. Call is a dry, low ""chimp"" remarkably similar to Song Sparrow.",小的，短尾的，浅棕色的鹪鹩，声音很大。微妙的图案，有模糊的苍白的眉毛和扩散的黑色条纹在两侧和翅膀。始终保持尾巴翘成一定角度。在各种森林栖息地发现，但总是喜欢潮湿的地方有浓密的缠结，通常在树木和苔藓周围。比鹪鹩肤色更深，体型更小，尾巴更短。令人难以置信的美妙歌曲是一长串的哨声和颤音;这是北方森林里常见的声音。Call是一种干枯、低矮的“黑猩猩”，与Song Sparrow非常相似。,https://ebird.org/species/winwre3

Females and immatures are duller but always have contrasting yellow throat and undertail coverts. Common and widespread breeder throughout North America. Found in shrubby wet areas, including marshes, forest edges, and fields. Often hides in thick vegetation, but males often perch conspicuously when singing. Listen for ringing “witchity-witchity-witchity” song and low, harsh call notes. Very short, rounded wings, which equates to it being a short-distance migrant: winters from the southern U.S. to Central America.",小莺，整体呈暗橄榄色，喉部呈深黄色。成年雄性有黑色的面具，上面有白色的镶边。雌性和未成熟的是沉闷的，但总是有对比黄色的喉部和尾下隐蔽。遍布北美的普通繁殖动物。见于灌木丛生的潮湿地区，包括沼泽、森林边缘和田野。通常隐藏在茂密的植被中，但雄性在唱歌时经常显眼地栖息。听着“女巫-女巫-女巫”的歌声和低沉刺耳的呼唤音。非常短的圆形翅膀，这意味着它是一种短途候鸟:冬季从美国南部到中美洲。,https://ebird.org/species/comyel
